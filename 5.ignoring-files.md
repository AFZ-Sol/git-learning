# 5. Git


### 5.1 Rules of patterns in the .gitignore files 

1. Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored.

2. Standard glob patterns work, and will be applied recursively throughout the entire working tree.

3. You can start patterns with a forward slash (/) to avoid recursivity.

4. You can end patterns with a forward slash (/) to specify a directory.

5. You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (!).


### 5.2 Example .gitignore file

```
# ignore all .a files
*.a

# but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
!lib.a

# only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdir/TODO
/TODO

# ignore all files in the build/ directory
build/

# ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
doc/*.txt

# ignore all .pdf files in the doc/ directory and any of its subdirectories
doc/**/*.pdf
```
