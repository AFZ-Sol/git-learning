## 10. Git line endings

Different OS handle line ending differently. 
>> Windows use (\r\n) pair  
>> OSX, Linux use (\n)

Git provides mechanism to handle line endings. There are two ways to do it:

### 10.1 Global Configuration
  
`git config --global core.autocrlf` command is used to configure line endings.  
`git config --global --edit` If you want to see in which it is saved.

You can use 1 of 3 available options:

1. core.autocrlf=true (Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style)  
	Git will convert LF to CRLF when checking out text files. When committing text files, CRLF will be converted to LF.  
	It is recommended on Windows.  
	`git config --global core.autocrlf true`
2. core.autocrlf=input (Checkout as-is, commit Unix-style)    
	Git will not perform any conversion when checking out text files. When committing text files, CRLF will be converted to LF.  
	It is recommended on OSX, Linux.  
	`git config --global core.autocrlf input`
3. core.autocrlf=false (Checkout as-is, commit as-is)    
	Git will not perform any conversions when checking out or committing text files.   	
	It is not recommended for cross-platform projects.  
	`git config --global core.autocrlf false` 


### 10.2 Per-repository configuration
You can configure the way Git manages line endings on a per-repository basis by configuring a special .gitattributes file.  
This file is committed into the repository and overrides an individual's core.autocrlf setting, ensuring consistent behavior for all users, regardless of their Git settings.  
*Note* : The .gitattributes file must be created in the root of the repository and committed like any other file.

*Example .gitattributes file.*

	#Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.
	* text=auto
	
	#Explicitly declare text files you want to always be normalized and converted to native line endings on checkout.
	*.c text
	*.h text
	
	# These files will never run through the `CRLF` to `LF` filter
	*.doc -text
	
	#Declare files that will always have CRLF line endings on checkout.
	*.sln text eol=crlf
	
	#Denote all files that are truly binary and should not be modified.
	*.png binary
	*.jpg binary  

*Following settings can be used in .gitattributes file.*

	text=auto
	Git will handle the files in whatever way it thinks is best. This is a good default option.
	text eol=crlf
	Git will always convert line endings to CRLF on checkout. You should use this for files that must keep CRLF endings, even on OSX or Linux.
	text eol=lf
	Git will always convert line endings to LF on checkout. You should use this for files that must keep LF endings, even on Windows.
	binary
	Git will understand that the files specified are not text, and it should not try to change them. The binary setting is also an alias for -text -diff.
