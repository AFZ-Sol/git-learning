## 9. Git submodules
Submodule is a repository embedded in your main repository.    
When you add a submodule in Git, you don't add the code of the submodule to the main repository, you only add information about the submodule that is added to the main repository.  
`.gitmodules` file will contains information of submodules.

### 9.1 Adding submodules

You can add submodule to a repository like this:
>> git submodule add https://github.com/ThirdPartyRepo Folder-Path-of-ThirdPartyRepo  

### 9.2 Cloning repo first time with submodules
If you are cloning your main repo for the first time and you also want to clone submodules inside it, you can use following command: 
>> git clone --recursive <main repo url>

### 9.3 Cloning submodules in existing repo
If you have already cloned main repo, you can clone submodules with following 
>> git submodule update --init  

or of you have nested submodules
  
>> git submodule update --init --recursive

### 9.4 Updating latest changes from submodules
If some of your submodules have new commits, you can pull new commits in your main repo by using following command:
>> git submodule update

### 9.5 Updating submodule URL or folder location
You can change URL of submodule of target location of submodule in `.gitmodules` file. After updating any information in `.gitmodules` file, you need to run following command:
>> git submodule sync
